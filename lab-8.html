      <h3>TJ's SuperAgent: "AJAX with Less Suck"</h3>
      
      <p>We are going to be using SuperAgent, instead of jQuery AJAX</p>

      <p>The benefit of using SuperAgent is that it sucks a lot less than just XHR, and waaaaay less than jQuery AJAX (who the hell made that stuff?)</p>

      <p>SuperAgent is much more inline how most HTTP libraries are going to use.</p>
