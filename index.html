	<h1>Mobile Application Design and Development</h1>
	<p>
		Mobile Application Design and Development is essentially what the title says. By the end of the course you will have all the design and technical ability to build and deploy a mobile application using modern web technologies.
	</p>
	<p>
		This website contains all important dates, links to readings and material, assignments, labs and examples that will be used in the course.
	</p>
	<p>
		The website itself is also a mobile application and can be accessed anywhere by a smartphone running a modern, evergreen browser.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please read the next section "Course Overview" carefully.
	</p>

	<h3>A Survey Course</h3>
	<p>
		This is a "survey course", where material regarding a subject is curated by the lecturer, read by the student, and tested through discussions, quizzes and assignments.
	</p>
	<p>
		For this reason, it is important that you understand a few key points about what a survey course is:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The course material goes beyond the website - required readings and other materials for this course are external to this website and it is your responsibility to create notes and provide synthesis 
		</li>
		<li>
			A self-motivated + self-directed learning environment - the material curated by your TA and myself was chosen to cover the most salient points of mobile application design and development, however there is always opportunity to expand on this knowledge and suggestions are welcome
		</li>
		<li>
			A work in progress - the course website and required materials may change throughout the course to reflect the progress of the students, also referred to as "just in time teaching" (JIT)
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Design</h3>
	<p>
		In this course we will be taking a look at several examples (online and video) of Human Interface Guidelines for mobile applications. These come from major industry players in an attempt to survey only the best and most current information.
	</p>
	<p>
		You will be graded on your ability to learn, synthesize, think citically about and apply the assigned materials. Many other resources exist and may supplement the required material, so do not be afraid to suggest or cite external sources.
	</p>
	<h3>Development</h3>
	<p>
		In your labs your TA will give you a brief overview and survey of some, but not all, leading web technologies used in industry to create mobile web applications.
	</p>
	<p>
		You are REQUIRED to use web technologies and no other tools or languages (even if they compile to a mobile web application) are to be used.
	</p>
	<p>
		You are NOT required to use the frameworks and libraries mentioned in the course, however, they were chosen for their heavy use in industry and may be the best choice for assignments.
	</p>
