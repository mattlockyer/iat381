		<h3>
			Redesigning a UX
		</h3>
		<p>
			In this assignment you are going to use SVG, CSS transforms, Canvas or WebGL to redesign a simple classic app with a COMPLETELY, RADICALLY NEW AND ORIGINAL User Experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			Just like assignment 1, this should be a single page application. If you need multiple views or routing, use a web framework like angular, react, vue, mithril, etc...
		</p>
		<p>
			Your application should be responsive and smooth with a modern look and feel.
		</p>
		
		<h3>
		    Good or Bad
		</h3>
		<p>
		    For this assignment you can come up with any new UX you like, it may work, it may not.
		</p>
		<p>
		    Personally I would try to do something radical and MAKE IT WORK WELL, but in the end, not all wild new ideas end up working well in production.
		</p>
		<p>
		    Try your best to produce something awesome that you're proud of, but be prepared to present equally about what worked and WHAT DID NOT WORK!
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			Design for the Phone!
		</h3>
		<p>
			Since we are working with web technologies you will hear the term responsive a lot.
		</p>e
		<p>
			Responsive means that your webapp will adapt whether it is run on a phone, tablet, or desktop.
		</p>
		<p>
			DO NOT focus on this when building your assignments, design for a phone, that is what Salehen and I will be using to mark your assignments.
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			Testing Your App
		</h3>
		<p>
			Make sure your app works on a iPhone 5 / Nexus 5 "ish" device. i.e. buttons are clickable and the viewport is sized so that when you look at it on a phone you can read the text etc...
		</p>
		<p>
			Use the meta viewport tag (see FAQ).
		</p>
		<p>
			*** Test with Chrome Dev Tools Device Emulation for things like multitouch (pinch, rotate, etc... ***
		</p>

		<h3>
			Application Choices
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Calculator</li>
			<li>Clock</li>
			<li>To Do List</li>
			<li>Calendar</li>
			<li>Camera</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Scope It!</h3>
		
		<p>
		    The point of this assignment is not to make an amazing application, as you can tell by the choices, they are standard apps that already have several good implementations.
		</p>
		<p>
		    Focus your time and energy instead, on completely redesigning the user experience, however radical your ideas may be, keep it scoped and have fun!

	<section name="FAQ" icon="face-unlock">

		<h3>
			What does my app have to be able to run on?
		</h3>
		<p>
		    Your app should be live on a gh-pages branch of a github repo. Salehen and myself will be using Google Chrome for Android (same as iOS) on a Nexus 5 and One Plus One.
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			How do I support a mobile layout and properly size my CSS pixels?
		</h3>
		<p>
		    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag">Read This</a> and then test on a phone or use Chrome developer tools (see below).
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			How can I test my app?
		</h3>
		<p>
		    You can use Google Chrome's developer tools to emulate mobile devices and even network speeds. Click the little phone icon in the top left to start emulation.
		</p>
		
				<h3>
			Do I have to support touch gestures?
		</h3>
		<p>
		    Yes, use a library like Hammer.js
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			Do I have to worry about my app running on other browsers? Tablets? Desktop?
		</h3>
		<p>
		    No.
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			What do you mean single page app?
		</h3>
		<p>
		    Your app should never leave the original index.html. Read up on this.
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			Do I have to compress, gzip, uglify etc...
		</h3>
		<p>
		    Only if you are running a pre-processor on less, sass, jsx, etc... You app should run live on gh-pages, i.e. only js, css, html are supported.
		</p>
