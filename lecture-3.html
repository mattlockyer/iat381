		<h3>Key Points from Questions</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't assume your design is perfect, expect to change</li>
			<li>Use qualitative feedback to improve your app (show your app to as many people as possible)</li>
			<li>Deploy early, often and in small doses</li>
			<li>List all features, do a cost benefit analysis (time to implement vs. impact for users)</li>
			<li>When you're considering adding a feature, consider what features can be removed</li>
			<li>Two types of regression: remove forever or remove to improve</li>
			<li>Use analytics to find out if your users are finding features, using features and how long it takes them to complete tasks</li>
			<li>Trello is a good feature / todo manager</li>
			<li>...</li>

		<h3>Dev Tools are Optional!</h3>
		<p>
		    We are going to be looking at a lot of tools in this course, but you need to keep in mind these are optional.
		</p>
		<p>
		    The tools we are showing you, are in fact intended to make your life more simple and are some of the most popular tools in industry today.
		</p>
		<p>
		    There may be a learning curve when incorporating a new tool into your workflow, sometimes the benefit outweighs the time taken to learn the tool, sometimes not. These are decisions you have to make!
		</p>
		<p>
		    Don't expect that things just run out of the box and stop panicing when they don't. Developer Tools are inherently opinionated and will often look and run like Greek to you the first time you try to use them.
		</p>
