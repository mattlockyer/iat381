      <h3>To get it out of the way... Servers</h3>
      <p>There are cases where Chrome simply doesn't like if your web page accesses remote information from a different protocol. And, most other remote information are sitting behind an HTTP server.</p>
      <p>Although, later on, we will not need a web server, but for this lab, and the next few ones, you will need one.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>XAMPP (on Windows, OS X, many Linux Distros)</li>
        <li>WAMP (on Windows)</li>
        <li>MAMP (on OS X)</li>
        <li>LAMP (on many Linux Distros)</li>
        <li>nws (using Node.js)</li>
        <li>http-server (using Node.js)</li>

    <section name='Git' icon='star'>
      <h3>Most important: managing versions of your app, using Git.</h3>
      <p>In this class, we will be using Git (or the GitHub client) and GitHub</p>
      <p>So install a Git client, and create an account on GitHub.</p>
    </section>

    <section name='DOM' icon='star'>
      <h3>How to lay out your page</h3>
      <p>The HTML you write tells the browser on how to build a tree.</p>
      <p>Each leaf of the node represents a box that contains text and images, and you can style these boxes (almost) however you like using CSS attributes.</p>
    </section>

    <section name='CSS' icon='star'>
      <h3>Styling your page</h3>
      <p>CSS is used to style your pages.</p>
      <p>When writing CSS, don't think of it as just styling your page. Think of it as a language to query the DOM, and then applying specific attributes to the queried DOM elements.</p>
    </section>

    <section name='JavaScript' icon='star'>
      <h3>Giving your app life</h3>
      <p>On most (if not, all) browsers, JavaScript is used for adding interactivity to your applications.</p>
      <p>Think of JavaScript as being bolted on to the browser, with features injected into the language to modify the web page's content (more specifically, the DOM).</p>
