		<h3>
			Welcome to the course!
		</h3>
		<p>
		I am personally excited to be teaching this course since it involves 2 things near and dear to my heart as a developer: the web and mobile experiences.
		</p>
		<p>
		Today I will be discussing the course as a whole and go over some of the resources you will be required to use and in some parts learn on your own in order to succeed.
		</p>
		<h3>On Brevity</h3>
		<p>
		You may notice that lecture notes are short. This is intentional for 3 reasons:
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>
		This is a survey course, read the "Course Outline" for more info about what that means
		</li>
		<li>
		The best resources and tutorials are already written and available online
		</li>
		<li>
		The resources are countless... These are some of the best materials your TA and myself could find
		</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			A large part of mobile application development is user experience. Desigining applications that communicate in "standard" ways that fit with a user's cognitive model of what is expected.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many companies have developed guidelines and standards for this communication with respect to mobile devices. We'll take a look at Apple's first.
		</p>
		<p>
			The following <strong>required readings</strong> are testable material, they will show up in quizzes and be required to be demonstrated in the execution of assignments.
