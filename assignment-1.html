		<h3>
			Building a Mobile Application using a Web Framework
		</h3>
		<p>
			In this assignment you are going to use a web framework to build a single page application (SPA).
		</p>
		<p>
			All of your applications resources will be included the first time a user visits your website and navigation will be handled by JavaScript though your frameworks routing module.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your application should be responsive and smooth with a modern look and feel.
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			Design for a Phone First!
		</h3>
		<p>
			Since we are working with web technologies you will hear the term responsive a lot.
		</p>
		<p>
			Responsive means that your website will adapt whether it is run on a phone, tablet, or desktop.
		</p>
		<p>
			DO NOT focus on this when building your assignments, design for a phone, that is what Salehen and I will be using to mark your assignments.
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			Testing Your App
		</h3>
		<p>
			Make sure your app works on a iPhone 5 / Nexus 5 "ish" device. i.e. buttons are clickable and the viewport is sized so that when you look at it on a phone you can read the text etc...
		</p>
