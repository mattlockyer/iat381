		<h3>
			Building a Mobile Application using a Web Framework
		</h3>
		<p>
			In this assignment you are going to use a web framework to build a single page application (SPA).
		</p>
		<p>
			All of your applications resources will be included the first time a user visits your website and navigation will be handled by JavaScript though your frameworks routing module.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your application should be responsive and smooth with a modern look and feel.
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			Design for a Phone First!
		</h3>
		<p>
			Since we are working with web technologies you will hear the term responsive a lot.
		</p>
		<p>
			Responsive means that your website will adapt whether it is run on a phone, tablet, or desktop.
		</p>
		<p>
			DO NOT focus on this when building your assignments, design for a phone, that is what Salehen and I will be using to mark your assignments.
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			Testing Your App
		</h3>
		<p>
			Make sure your app works on a iPhone 5 / Nexus 5 "ish" device. i.e. buttons are clickable and the viewport is sized so that when you look at it on a phone you can read the text etc...
		</p>

		<h3>
			What does my app have to be able to run on?
		</h3>
		<p>
		    Your app should be live on a gh-pages branch of a github repo. Salehen and myself will be using Google Chrome for Android (same as iOS) on a Nexus 5 and One Plus One.
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			How do I support a mobile layout and properly size my CSS pixels?
		</h3>
		<p>
		    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag">Read This</a> and then test on a phone or use Chrome developer tools (see below).
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			How can I test my app?
		</h3>
		<p>
		    You can use Google Chrome's developer tools to emulate mobile devices and even network speeds. Click the little phone icon in the top left to start emulation.
		</p>
		
				<h3>
			Do I have to support touch gestures?
		</h3>
		<p>
		    That's up to you and your app design.
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			How much content should I have?
		</h3>
		<p>
		    Keep it fairly small and focus on showing off some clean application logic (i.e. handling user input and displaying results through a controller and view template) and ABSOLUTELY FOCUS on design and ux. Your app should look and run REALLY WELL.
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			Do I have to worry about my app running on other browsers? Tablets? Desktop?
		</h3>
		<p>
		    No.
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			What do you mean single page app?
		</h3>
		<p>
		    Using a web framework and a routing module your app should never leave the original index.html. Read up on this.
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			Do I have to compress, gzip, uglify etc...
		</h3>
		<p>
		    Only if you are running a pre-processor on less, sass, jsx, etc... You app should run live on gh-pages, i.e. only js, css, html are supported.
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			How should I keep everything organized?
		</h3>
		<p>
		    Follow the file structure your framework prescribes, or use the following basic structure:
		</p>
		<pre>
   app/
     index.html
     js/
       controller1.js
       ...
     css/
       main.css
       ...
     img/
       ...
     bower_components (or libs) /
       ...
		</pre>
